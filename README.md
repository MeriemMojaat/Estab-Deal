# 🛍️ Estab'Deal – Sustainable Student Exchange Platform
A web-based platform developed for ESPRIT students to exchange unused clothing and items, encouraging sustainable habits and reducing waste through a point-based barter system.

# 🌍 Project Vision
Estab'Deal is more than just a clothes-swapping site — it’s a step toward sustainability. The platform enables students to recycle and repurpose unused clothing and items instead of discarding them. It promotes conscious consumption and supports SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.

# 🧩 How It Works
👕 Students upload photos and descriptions of unused items.

🔄 Others can propose exchanges or claim items using a point system.

💬 Users communicate to finalize exchanges.

🎯 With every successful trade, users earn points.

🛒 Points can be used to acquire items even without a direct trade.
